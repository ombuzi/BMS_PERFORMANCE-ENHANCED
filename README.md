About The Project
This project represents a significant advancement over standard EV BMS designs. It is a simulation framework for a top-tier control system engineered for uncompromising off-road performance. It is built to manage a battery pack under the immense stress of massive torque demands, aggressive regenerative braking, and harsh thermal environments.

The core philosophy is predictive power and proactive protection. The system uses a sophisticated digital twin of the battery to anticipate vehicle demands and environmental conditions, allowing it to safely push the powertrain to its absolute limits. It is designed for engineers developing electric rally cars, UTVs, and other high-performance all-terrain vehicles.

Key Features
State and Power Estimation: Implements a Dual Extended Kalman Filter (DEKF) for highly accurate, simultaneous estimation of State of Charge (SOC) and State of Health (SOH). A crucial State of Power (SOP) prediction algorithm allows the Vehicle Control Unit to command maximum available torque safely.

High-Throughput Active Balancing: Utilizes an efficient inductor-based active balancing topology. This system rapidly shuttles energy between cells, keeping the pack perfectly balanced for maximum performance, especially during high-current charge and discharge cycles.

Predictive Thermal Management: A smart, algorithm-driven thermal controller that anticipates high-load events. It pre-emptively activates a multi-zone liquid cooling system to prevent thermal throttling, ensuring peak power is always available.

Intelligent Safety and Derating: Instead of a simple power cut-off, a sophisticated Stateflow logic manager intelligently derates power based on a holistic view of cell health. This provides a robust "limp-home" capability critical for off-road reliability.

AI-Driven Longevity Prediction: A built-in Neural Network model estimates the battery's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on the specific stresses of off-road driving, offering far more insight than traditional SOH metrics.

Technical Stack
This project is built entirely within the MathWorks ecosystem:

MATLAB R2024a (or newer)

Simulink

Simscape Electrical

Deep Learning Toolbox

Control System Toolbox

Getting Started
To execute the simulation, the following software and toolboxes must be installed on your system.

Prerequisites
MATLAB R2024a or a more recent version.

All required toolboxes listed in the Technical Stack section.

How to Run a Simulation
Running a standard simulation test case follows these steps:

Open the Project: Launch MATLAB and open the main project file (BMS_Project.prj). This action will add all necessary folders to the MATLAB path.

Initialize the Model: Open and run the initialization script from the MATLAB command window:

Matlab

>> initialize_BMS_model
This script loads all battery parameters, drive cycle data, and control algorithm settings into the workspace.

Run Simulation: Open the main Simulink model file (BMS_Main_Harness.slx) and press the Run button.

Results, plots, and analysis will be automatically generated upon completion of the simulation.
